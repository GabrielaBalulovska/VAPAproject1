    <h1 align="center">Voice analysis and personal assistant.</h1>
<p>
The idea of this website is to introduce a new app that people can use exclusively for sending out voice recorded messages to people on all social media platforms chosen. The app allows you to connect your Facebook, instagram, email, and phone text message, to the app and use it to send a quick message through voice analysis. When sending a message you first state to the app where you want a message sent on ie. “Facebook, Send message to (Contact), and state what you want to say. The app will also be able to identify specifically what contact you want to message given that there is more than one with the same name. Wifi or 3g will need to be enables in order for V.A.P.E to be able to message individuals on internet platforms.

<p>

V.A.P.A is designed to ensure users have an option that is more efficient and easy for when it comes to messaging others. Voice recording yourself to either send a recorded or typed out a message is much quicker, which can be beneficial when you're on the go but need to contact someone by message at that point in time. It’s designed to do the work for you as the app goes to whatever platform you need and records for you while you’re able to continue what you may be doing instead of stopping everything you may be doing to type out a whole message to someone. V.A.P.A is useful for anyone as it can be used due to being too busy to simply send a message or just for everyday use as it is straightforward and easy to use.

    <h1 align="center"> Target </h1>
<p>
The age target for V.A.P.A is 16-30-year-olds, the app is an elegant design that is appealing for young teenagers and young professionals. This age group would find this app more engaging because they are commonly at the age where texting and messaging on social media is a more frequent interest. Nonetheless, adults older than 30 years old would likely find use in V.A.P.A, as it is a more simple alternative to physically messaging after all technology is becoming more complex and this app would be favourable for those who need assistance.

    <h1 align="center">Inspiration: Siri</h1>
<p>
    Siri is one of my inspirations as it is a service that is featured on ‘Apple’ products. The way Siri works is by a voice-activated assistant that listens to your instructions, such as setting a reminder, starting a call with someone, sending a text message, adding things to calendar, and searching things up on google.

<div>
   <h1 align="center">Inspiration: Google Assistant</h1>
<p>
Google assistant is another app used as inspiration because it is a platform that included voice commands and assists its user. Google assistant basically does any command for you possible, the application can search things up, control your device, access information such as notes, control music and much more.

 <h2 align="center">Visual Style</h2>
<p>
V.A.P.A visual aim is to have an elegant appeal, the design is quite limited with just two minimalistic logos and about four colours used. The minimalistic look draws attention to the website as it becomes more engaging as it has no distractions and causes the viewer to stay and use the website for longer. 

Font used for titles is 'Impact', the font is a tidy simple but bold, it is used for titles to create a graceful view.
